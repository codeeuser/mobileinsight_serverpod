# MobileInsight Serverpod

A new Flutter project with Serverpod for reading the server log messages.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that is using
Serverpod.

A great starting point for learning Serverpod is our documentation site at:
[https://docs.serverpod.dev](https://docs.serverpod.dev).

To run the project, first make sure that the server is running, then do:

    flutter run


## License
All MobileInsight packages are licensed under BSD-3, except for the main `mobileinsightserverpod` package, which uses the SSPL license. In short, this means that you can, without limitation, use any of the client packages in your app. You can also host your MobileInsight server without limitation as long as you do not offer mobileinsightserverpod as a cloud service to 3rd parties (this is typically only relevant for cloud service providers).
